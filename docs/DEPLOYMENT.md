# Night for Two — standalone deployment

## Boundary

This repository runs the application. The MARINS Reminder Bot remains the owner of conversation analysis and relationship-history collection.

The only cross-project integration is:

```
Night for Two -> RELATIONSHIP_CONTEXT_URL
```

The connector accepts sanitized aggregate context and rejects raw-message payloads.

## Local Docker

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d --build
```

Application:

```
http://localhost:5681/night
http://localhost:5681/night/health
```

## Required secrets

Never commit real values.

- `DATABASE_URL`
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`
- `PRIMARY_OWNER_ID`
- `PARTNER_TELEGRAM_ID`
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
- `RELATIONSHIP_CONTEXT_URL`
- `RELATIONSHIP_CONTEXT_TOKEN`

## Public HTTPS

Cloudflare components live in:

- `cloudflare/night-pages`
- `cloudflare/night-gateway`

The public base URL is stored in `NIGHT_PAGES_URL` outside Git.

`tools/publish-pages.ps1` verifies `/night/health` and updates the Telegram Web App menu for the two configured accounts. It contains no built-in Telegram IDs.

## Full novel generation

Use the manual workflow `.github/workflows/generate-full-novel.yml`.

It starts the standalone Docker stack, probes the novel store, runs generation, and requires the final status probe to report complete.

## Rollback

Application code and relationship-history data are separated. A Night for Two rollback must not touch the bot database or conversation-analysis state.
